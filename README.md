VeriPass is a secure digital verification and attendance system that integrates **RFID**, **IoT**, and **web technologies** to automate attendance tracking and identity verification.  
This project is part of my Final Year Project (FYP), currently under active development.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎫 **RFID-Based Authentication** — Detects and verifies users using RFID cards or tags.  
- 🌐 **Web Dashboard** — Allows admin and lecturers to manage users, courses, and attendance records.
- 🔐 **Access Logic** - Based on the student's enrolled course schedule and location to determine access.
- 📶 **Real-Time Data Sync** — Attendance logs are uploaded instantly via Wi-Fi-enabled IoT devices (ESP32).  
- 🔒 **Secure Verification** — Prevents duplication and spoofing through encrypted communication between devices and the backend.
